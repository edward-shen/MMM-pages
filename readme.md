## Maintainer needed

Hello, it's been 5 years since I've written this! While I'm happy to see it
thriving, it's also about time I step away. I haven't had a magic mirror up
in years, and to be frank, I'm hoping someone else will be willing to take
up maintainership of the project.

I find this project to be in a near complete form. Other than a few mishaps of
me not having proper testing before pushing out code, more often than not any
problems that people have usually isn't often because of this project. The few
issues that do exist aren't very hard to fix nor are they severe that they
impact the project in any large manner. It's just I haven't had the time nor
motivation to fix them.

I don't think there are expectations for this project to have new features, so
a maintainer should really only need to just make sure people are getting help
when they raise issues and fix the rare bug that pops out every so often. If
you're interested, please don't hesitate to reach out.

# MMM-pages

This [MagicMirrorÂ²][mm] Module allows you to have pages in your magic mirror!
Want to have more modules in your magic mirror, but want to keep the format?
Or, want to have grouped modules that are themed together? Look no further!

![Example](example.webp)

Note that this module does not provide any method of manually changing the page!
You should ask other developers to add a notification to their modules, or add
one yourself!

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-pages.git
```

Configure the module in your config.js file.

To display what page you're on, I'd highly recommend checking out my
[page indicator module][page indicator].

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file.
Note: module names used in the following example are fictitious. this approach uses the module names as the page organization technique, as the modulename is added as a css class in the MM page content. 
Because  the modulename is used, this approach does not support multiple instances of the same module with data 
on different pages. (like your calendar on page 1, and someone elses on page 2)

```js
modules: [
    {
        module: 'MMM-pages',
        config: {
                modules:
                    [[ "newsfeed" ],
                     [ "calendar", "compliments" ]],
                fixed: [ "clock", "weather", "MMM-page-indicator" ],
                hiddenPages: {
                    "screenSaver": [ "clock", "MMM-SomeBackgroundImageModule" ],
                    "admin": [ "MMM-ShowMeSystemStatsModule", "MMM-AnOnScreenMenuModule" ],
                },
        }
    }
]
```

and alternative approach, is to define a fixed MMM-Pages config

```js
modules: [
    {
        module: 'MMM-pages',
        config: {
                modules:
                    [[ "page1" ],
                     [ "page2" ],
                     [ "page3" ],
                    ],
                fixed: [ "fixed_page" ],
                hiddenPages: {
                    "screenSaver": [ "screensaver_page" ],
                    "admin": [ "admin_page" ],
                },
        }
    }
]
```
and then at each module, add a classes: property to indicate the page(s) this is supposed to appear on
```
  { 
    module:"newsfeed",
    classes:"page1",
  },
  {
    module:"calendar",
    classes:"page2",
  },
  {
    module:"compliments",
    classes:"page2",
  }
```
etc

if u want a modules content on multiple pages the classes has those page names
```
  { 
    module:"newsfeed",
    classes:"page1",
  },
  {
    module:"calendar",  // first calendar instance on page 2
    classes:"page2",
  },
  {
    module:"calendar",  // second calendar instance on page 3
    classes:"page3",
  },  
  {
    module:"compliments",
    classes:"page1 page2",
  }
```

## Configuration options

| Option | Type | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `modules`           | `[[String...]...]`         | `[]`                     | A 2D String array of what each module should be on which page. Note that all entries must take their class name (e.g. this module's class name is `MMM-pages`, while the default modules may just have `newsfeed`, without the `MMM-` prefix. |
| `fixed`             | `[String...]`              | `["MMM-page-indicator"]` | Which modules should show up all the time. |
| `excludes`          | *NA*                       | *NA*                     | **Deprecated**. Use `fixed` instead. |
| `hiddenPages`       | `{String: [String...]...}` | `{}`                     | An Object defining special `hiddenPages` which are not available on the normal page rotation and only accassible via a notification. Modules defined in `fixed` are ignored and need to be also added if you wish to have them on any hidden page. |
| `animationTime`     | `int`                      | `1000`                   | Fading animation time. Set to `0` for instant change. Value is in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds). |
| `rotationTime`      | `int`                      | `0`                      | Time, in milliseconds, between automatic page changes. |
| `rotationDelay`     | `int`                      | `10000`                  | Time, in milliseconds, of how long should a manual page change linger before returning to automatic page changing. In other words, how long should the timer wait for after you manually change a page. This does include the animation time, so you may wish to increase it by a few seconds or so to account for the animation time. |
| `rotationHomePage`  | `int`                      | `0`                      | Time, in milliseconds, before automatically returning to the home page. If a home page is not set, this returns to the leftmost page instead. |
| `rotationFirstPage` | *NA*                       | *NA*                     | **Deprecated**. Use `rotationHomePage` instead. |
| `homePage`          | `int`                      | `0`                      | Which page index is the home page. If none is set, this returns to the leftmost page instead. |
| `useLockString`     | `bool`                     | `true`                   | Whether or not to use a lock string to show or hide pages. If disabled, other modules may override when modules may be shown. _Advanced users only. Only override this if you know what you're doing._

For the `module` configuration option, the first element of the outer array
should consist of elements that should be on the first page. The second element
should consist of elements that should be on the second page, and so forth.

## Notifications

The following is the list of notifications that MMM-pages will handle:

| Notification | Payload type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PAGE_CHANGED`      | `int`           | MMM-pages will switch to the provided page index. |
| `PAGE_INCREMENT`    | `int`, Optional | MMM-pages will increment the page, or by `n` times if a number is provided. Not providing a number is equivalent to sending a payload of `1`. If there are no more pages to increment by, this will loop around to the first page. |
| `PAGE_DECREMENT`    | `int`, Optional | MMM-pages will decrement the page, or by `n` times if a number is provided. Not providing a number is equivalent to sending a payload of `1`. If there are no more pages to decrement by, this will loop around to the last page. |
| `QUERY_PAGE_NUMBER` | *None*          | MMM-pages will respond with `PAGE_NUMBER_IS` with the current page index. |
| `PAUSE_ROTATION`    | *None*          | If MMM-pages is set to rotate, this will pause rotation until a `RESUME_ROTATION` notification is sent. This does nothing if rotation was already paused. |
| `RESUME_ROTATION`   | *None*          | If MMM-pages was requested to pause rotation, this will resume automatic rotation. This does nothing MMM-pages was not requested to pause. |
| `HOME_PAGE`         | *None*          | Return to the home page. If no home page is provided, return to the first page instead. |
| `SHOW_HIDDEN_PAGE`  | `String`        | MMM-pages will switch to the provided hidden page name. |
| `LEAVE_HIDDEN_PAGE` | *None*          | MMM-pages will leave the currently showing hidden page and return to the previous showing page index. |

The following is the list of notifications that MMM-pages sends out:

| Notification        | Payload type | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAX_PAGES_CHANGED` | `int`        | This is sent only once during initialization of MMM-pages. This contains the number of pages defined in `config.js`.                                           |
| `NEW_PAGE`          | `int`        | This notification is sent out on every page change and contains the current page index. This is to help other modules keep track of what the current page is. This is also sent out during initialization. |
| `PAGE_NUMBER_IS`    | `int`        | Sent in response to a `QUERY_PAGE_NUMBER` notification. Returns the current page index. This notification sends the same payload as `NEW_PAGE`.                |

### Notes

This module responds to the notification `PAGE_CHANGED` and the payload strictly
must be an `integer`. Note that this has strict error checking, so `"3"` will
not work, while `3` will.

This module keeps track of pages by their index rather than their page number,
so the leftmost page has an index of 0, the page to the right of that has an
index of 1, and the page to the right of that has an index of 2. Thus, to change
to the third page, your module should send out:

```js
this.sendNotification("PAGE_CHANGED", 2);
```

This module keeps internal track of how many pages you have, defined by your
config in the config file. There is no way to dynamically change the pages you
have. If there arises a need, please create an issue.

This module does not enforce how other modules represents or even responds to
MMM-pages notifications.

### Initialization

_This section provides documentation on what notifications the module sends on
startup. This section isn't necessary to read for most users._

MMM-pages doesn't activate until we receive the `DOM_OBJECTS_CREATED`
notification, as that notification ensures all modules have been loaded. On this
notification, we send two notifications out, `MAX_PAGES_CHANGED` and `NEW_PAGE`,
so other modules that would like to keep synchronized of the starting page and
max pages have a way to determine which page to start on.

### Hidden pages

The idea behind hidden pages is to be able to create special "modes" which
are totally configurable by the user and are seperated from the "normal" MMÂ² operation.
Some examples would be a "guest", "admin" or "screensaver" mode, where only very
specific modules are shown and you do not want to have them in your normal page roation.

These hidden pages are only accessible via notifications, so you need to send them from
other modules. Examples integrations could be with touch, bots or voice commands.

## FAQ

- How do I interact with different pages?

  MMM-pages intentionally does not provide methods to interact with the pages.
  This is intentional by design, as there are too many ways to interact with a
  Magic Mirror. [MMM-page-indicator][page indicator] does provide a way to click
  on the circles to change pages, but this requires the ability to click or tap
  on the circles itself. If no other method is available, MMM-pages provides an
  automatic rotation feature.

- Help! My module is (above/below) another module in the same region but I want
  it to be somewhere else!

  The order of your `config.js` determines your module location. If you have two
  modules, both with `position:bottom_bar`, the one that is first listed will
  appear on top. The rest will appear in the same order you defined them in. If
  you want this module to be at the very bottom, define this module as the last
  module in your `config.js` file. If you want it to be on top in that region,
  make sure no other module is defined before it that has the same region.
